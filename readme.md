# Emeji Connection Monitor

A simple utility I created while in a tiff with my ISP.

Unfortunately, they moved to a new system, and as I write this, we are diagnosing why my internet connection resembles a square wave. Not exactly fun.

This is an electron app. Feel free to build from source here, or find the current build below.

To build from source:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/elliottmejia/Emeji-Connection-Monitor
# 2. Install deps
npm i
# 3. Build
npm build
```
Optionally, you can just run from source.
```bash
# ... steps 1, 2...
# 3. Start server in dev mode
npm start
```

Untested on Linux and Windows.
