# Emeji Connection Monitor

A simple utility I created while in a tiff with my ISP.

Unfortunately, they moved to a new system, and as I write this, we are diagnosing why my internet connection resembles a square wave. Not exactly fun.

This is an electron app. Feel free to build from source here, or find the current build below.

Untested on Linux and Windows.
